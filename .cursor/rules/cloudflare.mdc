# Cloudflare Worker & Backend Rules

## Sync API & Protocol
- Implement `/sync/pull` and `/sync/push` endpoints using WatermelonDB sync protocol (pull-then-push, delta-based, per-collection changes)
- Use server-side timestamps (`Date.now()`) for `last_modified` and `deleted_at`; ignore client-provided timestamps for these fields
- Scope all sync queries and mutations to the authenticated user's `org_id`
- On push, if any record's `last_modified > lastPulledAt`, abort the push and return 409 Conflict
- Use transactions or batch operations for atomicity when applying push changes

## Real-Time Sync (WebSockets & Durable Objects)
- Use Durable Objects to coordinate WebSocket connections per org for real-time sync notifications
- Authenticate WebSocket connections using JWT (via query param or initial message)
- After successful push, notify the org's Durable Object to broadcast a sync event to all connected clients
- WebSocket channel is only a trigger; all data sync must go through the standard sync API

## General
- Prefer TypeScript for all backend code
- Use kebab-case for filenames
- Keep backend files focused: separate routing, auth, sync logic, and D1 access
- Document any deviations from the protocol or schema in DEVELOPMENT.md
