# Task ID: 101
# Title: Implement Fog of War System
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a fog of war system that reveals parts of the game map as the player explores. The system should persist the explored areas.
# Details:
The fog of war will hide unexplored areas of the game map. As the player character moves, a certain number of "nodes" (e.g., rooms, grid cells) in each direction will be revealed. The state of the fog of war (which areas are revealed) must be saved to the database so that it can be restored when the player resumes their game. This will likely involve modifications to the game state and the database schema.

# Test Strategy:
- Unit tests for the fog of war logic (e.g., calculating revealed nodes based on player position).
- Integration tests to ensure the fog of war state is correctly saved to and loaded from the database with the game session.
- End-to-end tests to verify that the UI correctly displays the fog of war and updates as the player moves.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Fog of War data structure
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Decide how to represent the fog of war data. A 2D array or a set of coordinates for revealed nodes are possibilities. This will be part of the character's progression data.

## 2. Modify database schema
### Dependencies: 101.1
### Description: Add a field to a relevant table (e.g., `characters` or a new table) to store the fog of war data. Create a migration for this change.

## 3. Implement backend logic
### Dependencies: 101.2
### Description: Update the game logic to calculate the visible area around the player. Modify the game state loading/saving logic to include the fog of war data. Create or update API endpoints to expose the fog of war data to the frontend.

## 4. Implement frontend rendering
### Dependencies: 101.3
### Description: Update the UI to render the fog of war overlay on the game map. The UI should update in real-time as the player explores new areas.

## 5. Connect backend and frontend
### Dependencies: 101.4
### Description: Integrate the frontend with the new API endpoints to fetch and display the fog of war.
