# Task ID: 5
# Title: Create Room System and Ship Navigation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Build dynamic room exploration system with procedural unlocking and state management
# Details:
Implement room navigation with collision detection and movement system. Create room state management (locked/unlocked, damaged/repaired, explored/unexplored). Design room template system for reusable layouts and configurable content. Implement progressive room unlocking based on story progression and technology discovery. Create environmental storytelling through room descriptions and discoverable logs. Build initial ship areas: Stargate room, corridors, quarters, mess hall, medical bay.

# Test Strategy:
Room navigation tests, collision detection verification, room state persistence tests, unlock condition validation, template system functionality tests

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement core room navigation mechanics [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the foundational system for moving between rooms including directional movement, room transitions, and basic navigation state tracking
### Details:
Build the core navigation system that handles player movement between rooms. Include directional controls (north, south, east, west), room transition logic, and maintain current room state. Implement basic room identification and tracking system.

## 2. Develop collision detection system [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Implement collision detection for room boundaries, blocked passages, and interactive elements within rooms
### Details:
Create collision detection system that prevents invalid movements, handles blocked doorways, and manages interaction boundaries. Include checks for room exits, obstacles, and interactive objects. Ensure smooth integration with navigation mechanics.

## 3. Build room state management system [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Create comprehensive room state tracking including visited status, discovered items, environmental changes, and persistent room data
### Details:
Implement room state management to track room exploration status, item interactions, environmental modifications, and any persistent changes. Include save/load functionality for room states and efficient state synchronization across game sessions.

## 4. Design and implement room template system [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2, 5.3
### Description: Create a flexible template system for defining room layouts, connections, properties, and content that supports easy expansion
### Details:
Build a template-based room generation system using JSON or similar configuration format. Include room properties, connection definitions, interactive elements, and expansion hooks. Design for modularity and easy addition of new room types.

## 5. Implement unlock progression logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.3, 5.4
### Description: Create system for room unlocking based on story progression, item collection, or other game events
### Details:
Develop progression system that controls room accessibility based on game state, collected items, completed objectives, or story milestones. Include validation logic, progression tracking, and integration with room template system.

## 6. Create initial ship area rooms [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.4, 5.5
### Description: Design and implement the starting ship area rooms using the template system, including basic room connections and initial game content
### Details:
Create the initial set of ship rooms using the implemented template system. Include starting room, basic ship areas (bridge, cargo, engineering), room descriptions, and initial interactive elements. Ensure proper room connections and progression flow.
