# Task ID: 4
# Title: Develop Character System and Game State Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement player character creation, progression, and real-time game state synchronization
# Details:
Create character entity with stats (health, hunger, thirst, fatigue), skills, and progression system. Implement real-time survival mechanics with automatic state updates. Design game state management using React Context for frontend state and optimistic updates. Create save/load system with automatic cloud synchronization, conflict resolution, and offline capability. Implement character progression tracking and skill development.

# Test Strategy:
Character creation tests, survival mechanics simulation, state synchronization tests, save/load integrity tests, offline mode functionality tests

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement character creation system [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build comprehensive character creation interface with customization options and validation
### Details:
Create character creation UI with stats allocation, appearance customization, name validation, and character archetype selection. Include data validation and proper error handling for invalid character configurations.

## 2. Develop survival mechanics implementation [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Implement core survival mechanics including health, hunger, thirst, and environmental effects
### Details:
Build survival mechanics engine with health degradation, resource consumption, environmental damage calculations, and status effect systems. Include edge case handling for extreme values and conflicting effects.

## 3. Create real-time state updates system [done]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Implement real-time game state broadcasting and client synchronization
### Details:
Build WebSocket-based real-time update system for character states, survival metrics, and world events. Handle connection drops, reconnection logic, and state reconciliation between client and server.

## 4. Build game state synchronization [done]
### Dependencies: 4.3
### Description: Implement conflict resolution and state consistency across multiple clients
### Details:
Create conflict resolution algorithms for simultaneous actions, implement authoritative server model, and handle state desynchronization scenarios. Include rollback mechanisms and state validation.

## 5. Develop save/load functionality [done]
### Dependencies: 4.4
### Description: Implement persistent game state storage and retrieval system
### Details:
Build robust save/load system with data serialization, corruption detection, backup mechanisms, and migration support. Handle partial saves, concurrent access, and data integrity validation.

## 6. Create progression tracking system [done]
### Dependencies: 4.5
### Description: Implement character progression, achievements, and milestone tracking
### Details:
Build progression system tracking character stats, skills, achievements, and game milestones. Include progress validation, rollback protection, and progress synchronization across sessions.
