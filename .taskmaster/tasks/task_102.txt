# Task ID: 102
# Title: Implement Save/Load Game System
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: [4]
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a system for players to save their game progress and load it later. This involves creating backend APIs for managing save data and frontend UI for player interaction.
# Details:
This task covers the full-stack implementation of a save/load game feature.

**Backend:**
- Create API endpoints under `/api/saves` for creating, listing, and retrieving saved games.
- The create endpoint will accept a JSON blob of the game state. Storing this in a Cloudflare Durable Object is a strong possibility to consider.
- The API must be secured so users can only access their own save files.
- The list endpoint should return metadata for the user's saves (e.g., save name, timestamp).
- The retrieve endpoint will return the full game state JSON blob for a specific save.

**Frontend:**
- Implement a 'Save Game' UI, allowing the player to name their save.
- Implement a 'Load Game' UI that lists the player's existing saves and allows them to select one to restore.
- Integrate these UI components with the new backend API endpoints.

# Test Strategy:
- Backend: Unit tests for the save/load logic and integration tests for the API endpoints, including auth.
- Frontend: Component tests for the save/load UI and E2E tests for the full save/load user flow.
- Verification: Ensure that saving and then loading a game restores the exact same game state.
