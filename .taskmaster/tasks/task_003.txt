# Task ID: 3
# Title: Build Core API Framework and Database Schema
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement RESTful API endpoints and database schema with proper migrations and seeding
# Details:
Create API routes: /api/auth/*, /api/game/*, /api/character/*, /api/rooms/*, /api/npcs/*, /api/technology/*. Implement rate limiting, security measures, error handling, and OpenAPI documentation. Design database schema with proper relationships, indexes, and constraints. Create migration system for schema updates and data seeding for initial game content. Implement CRUD operations with proper validation and error responses.

# Test Strategy:
API endpoint tests, database migration tests, rate limiting verification, security penetration tests, performance tests for sub-100ms response times

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design database schema for authentication system [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create comprehensive database schema for user authentication including users, sessions, roles, and permissions tables with proper relationships and constraints
### Details:
Design tables for users (id, username, email, password_hash, created_at, updated_at), sessions (id, user_id, token, expires_at), roles (id, name, permissions), and user_roles junction table. Include proper indexes, foreign key constraints, and security considerations for password storage.

## 2. Implement authentication endpoints and middleware [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Build complete authentication API with registration, login, logout, token refresh, and JWT middleware for route protection
### Details:
Create POST /auth/register, POST /auth/login, POST /auth/logout, POST /auth/refresh endpoints. Implement JWT token generation, validation middleware, password hashing with bcrypt, and proper error handling for authentication failures.

## 3. Design and implement game state management schema [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Create database schema and API endpoints for managing game states, sessions, and player progression
### Details:
Design tables for games (id, name, status, created_by, max_players), game_sessions (id, game_id, status, current_turn), player_games (user_id, game_id, role, status). Implement CRUD endpoints for game creation, joining, state updates, and real-time synchronization.

## 4. Implement character operations API [done]
### Dependencies: 3.2
### Description: Build comprehensive character management system with CRUD operations for character creation, customization, and inventory management
### Details:
Create tables for characters (id, user_id, name, class, level, stats), character_inventory (character_id, item_id, quantity), character_skills. Implement endpoints for character creation, updates, skill progression, equipment management, and character deletion with proper authorization checks.

## 5. Develop room management system [done]
### Dependencies: 3.3
### Description: Create room-based game architecture with dynamic room creation, player management, and real-time communication support
### Details:
Design rooms table (id, name, game_type, max_players, status), room_players (room_id, user_id, role), room_messages. Implement WebSocket support for real-time updates, room creation/joining/leaving endpoints, and proper cleanup mechanisms for abandoned rooms.

## 6. Build database migration system [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Implement comprehensive database migration framework with version control, rollback capabilities, and automated deployment support
### Details:
Create migrations table for version tracking, implement migration runner with up/down methods, seed data management, and automated backup before migrations. Include CLI commands for creating, running, and rolling back migrations with proper error handling and logging.

## 7. Create comprehensive API documentation [done]
### Dependencies: 3.2, 3.4, 3.5
### Description: Generate complete API documentation with interactive examples, authentication guides, and integration instructions
### Details:
Set up OpenAPI/Swagger documentation with all endpoints, request/response schemas, authentication requirements, error codes, and rate limiting information. Include Postman collection, SDK examples, and deployment guides for different environments.
