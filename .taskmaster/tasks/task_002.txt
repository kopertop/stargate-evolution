# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Common Type System and Data Models
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create shared TypeScript types and Zod schemas for all game entities across frontend and backend
# Details:
Define core entities using Zod schemas: User, GameSession, Character, Room, NPC, Item, Technology. Create template system types: RoomTemplate, PersonTemplate, TechnologyTemplate, DialogueTemplate. Implement runtime validation, type safety, and data transformation utilities. Setup shared utility functions for game logic calculations. Ensure consistent data models between client and server with proper serialization/deserialization.

# Test Strategy:
Schema validation tests, type safety verification, data transformation unit tests, serialization/deserialization tests, cross-package type consistency tests

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design core entity schemas and domain types [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define foundational TypeScript types for game entities, rooms, players, and core game state structures
### Details:
Create comprehensive schemas for Room, Player, GameState, Door, and Template entities. Include proper typing for all properties, relationships, and state transitions. Focus on immutability patterns and clear interfaces.

## 2. Implement template system type definitions [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Create robust typing for room templates, door templates, and template validation logic
### Details:
Define Template, RoomTemplate, DoorTemplate interfaces with proper generic constraints. Include template metadata types, configuration options, and template inheritance patterns.

## 3. Build validation utility types and runtime validators [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2
### Description: Develop type-safe validation functions and schema validation utilities
### Details:
Create Zod schemas or similar validation logic that matches TypeScript types. Include runtime type guards, validation helpers, and error handling types for all core entities.

## 4. Create transformation function types and utilities [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2
### Description: Define types for data transformation functions between different representations
### Details:
Build transformation utilities for converting between API responses, internal state, and UI representations. Include mapper types, serialization/deserialization functions, and format conversion utilities.

## 5. Implement shared game logic types [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3
### Description: Define types for game rules, state transitions, and business logic operations
### Details:
Create types for game actions, event handlers, state machine definitions, and rule validation. Include command types, game flow control, and interaction pattern definitions.

## 6. Establish cross-package consistency verification [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5
### Description: Create type checking utilities and tests to ensure consistency across frontend and backend packages
### Details:
Build automated type consistency checks, shared type exports, and integration tests. Include CI/CD type validation, breaking change detection, and cross-package type compatibility verification.
