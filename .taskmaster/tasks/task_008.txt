# Task ID: 8
# Title: Develop Turn-Based Combat Framework
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create D&D-style strategic combat system with dice rolls, modifiers, and multiple resolution paths
# Details:
Implement turn-based combat mechanics with dice rolls and modifiers. Create combat against ship malfunctions, alien creatures, and environmental hazards. Build multiple combat resolution paths (negotiation, stealth, direct confrontation). Implement combat consequences affecting future encounters and story branches. Design combat UI with clear action options, outcome visualization, and tactical information. Add equipment system affecting combat capabilities.

# Test Strategy:
Combat mechanics tests, dice roll probability verification, resolution path validation, consequence tracking tests, equipment impact tests

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and implement turn-based combat engine [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the core turn-based combat system with initiative order, action points, and turn management
### Details:
Implement initiative system for determining turn order, action point allocation per turn, turn state management, and transition between player/AI turns. Include validation for legal moves and turn completion conditions.

## 2. Implement dice roll system and probability mechanics [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Build the dice rolling engine with various dice types, modifiers, and probability calculations
### Details:
Create dice rolling functions supporting multiple dice types (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20), implement modifier system for bonuses/penalties, add probability display for player decision-making, and ensure deterministic seeding for testing.

## 3. Create multiple combat resolution paths [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Design various combat actions and resolution mechanics beyond basic attacks
### Details:
Implement attack options (melee, ranged, special abilities), defensive actions (dodge, block, parry), environmental interactions, and skill-based resolution paths. Each path should have distinct risk/reward profiles.

## 4. Build consequence tracking and persistence system [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.3
### Description: Implement system to track combat outcomes and their effects on the narrative
### Details:
Create data structures to store combat results, character status changes, injury/death consequences, and narrative flags. Implement persistence to save/load combat state and integrate with story progression system.

## 5. Develop combat UI with tactical feedback [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.4
### Description: Create user interface for combat with clear action options and outcome visualization
### Details:
Design combat interface showing turn order, available actions, probability indicators, health/status displays, and combat log. Include visual feedback for dice rolls, damage calculations, and tactical information to help players make informed decisions.
