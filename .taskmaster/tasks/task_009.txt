# Task ID: 9
# Title: Create Game UI/UX and Canvas Rendering System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement responsive game interface with Canvas-based 2D rendering and cross-platform controller support
# Details:
Build Canvas-based 2D rendering for game world visualization with 60 FPS performance target. Create responsive UI supporting multiple screen sizes and orientations. Implement clean, minimalist HUD with context-sensitive interaction prompts. Add cross-platform controller support (gamepad, keyboard/mouse, touch). Create accessible design with colorblind support, high contrast modes, and scalable UI elements. Implement PWA capabilities for offline play and mobile app-like experience.

# Test Strategy:
Rendering performance tests, cross-platform input tests, accessibility compliance verification, responsive design tests, PWA functionality validation
