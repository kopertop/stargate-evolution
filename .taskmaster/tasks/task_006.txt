# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Inventory and Resource Management System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create comprehensive inventory system with resource collection, storage, and strategic allocation mechanics
# Details:
Design inventory system with limited storage encouraging strategic decisions. Implement resource collection (parts, food, water, energy cells) and scavenging mechanics. Create resource allocation system affecting ship systems and crew survival. Build trade-off mechanics between immediate needs and long-term improvements. Implement item categories, durability, and usage systems. Add inventory UI with drag-and-drop functionality and sorting options.

# Test Strategy:
Inventory capacity tests, resource collection mechanics, allocation decision impact tests, item persistence tests, UI interaction tests

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Storage System Architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the core storage system design with capacity limits, item types, and storage tiers
### Details:
Define storage capacity mechanics, item categorization (resources, equipment, consumables), storage tier progression (basic containers to advanced vaults), and capacity expansion methods. Include storage location types (personal, base, shared) and access control systems.

## 2. Implement Resource Collection Mechanics [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Build the systems for gathering, harvesting, and acquiring various game resources
### Details:
Create resource nodes, collection tools, gathering efficiency systems, resource quality variations, and collection skill progression. Include resource respawn mechanics, seasonal availability, and environmental factors affecting collection rates.

## 3. Develop Allocation Algorithms [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2
### Description: Create intelligent systems for resource distribution and priority management
### Details:
Implement automated resource sorting, priority-based allocation for crafting/construction, emergency reserve systems, and predictive allocation based on usage patterns. Include manual override capabilities and allocation preset configurations.

## 4. Build Trade-off Decision Systems [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2, 6.3
### Description: Implement strategic choice mechanisms that create meaningful resource management decisions
### Details:
Design scarcity mechanics that force strategic choices, opportunity cost calculations, resource conversion systems, and strategic stockpiling vs immediate use decisions. Include consequence systems for poor resource management and reward systems for efficient allocation.

## 5. Create Inventory UI Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.3, 6.4
### Description: Build comprehensive user interface for inventory management and strategic decision making
### Details:
Design intuitive inventory grids, drag-and-drop functionality, sorting and filtering options, resource allocation interfaces, and visual indicators for scarcity/abundance. Include quick-action buttons, batch operations, and strategic overview dashboards showing resource trends and allocation efficiency.
