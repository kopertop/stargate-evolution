# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds interactive elevator console functionality to the Stargate Evolution game, allowing players to move between different floors of multi-level structures. Players will be able to interact with elevator consoles to open a floor selection menu and travel to different levels within the same building or ship layout.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to interact with elevator consoles to access a floor selection menu, so that I can navigate between different levels of multi-floor structures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player approaches an elevator console furniture item THEN the system SHALL detect the player is within interaction range
2. WHEN a player activates an elevator console (via spacebar, A button, or touch) THEN the system SHALL display a floor selection menu
3. WHEN the floor selection menu is displayed THEN the system SHALL show all available floors for the current building/layout
4. WHEN the floor selection menu is displayed THEN the system SHALL highlight the player's current floor
5. WHEN the floor selection menu is displayed THEN the system SHALL pause normal game movement and input

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want to select a destination floor from the elevator menu, so that I can travel to different levels efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the floor selection menu is open THEN the player SHALL be able to navigate between floor options using keyboard, gamepad, or touch input
2. WHEN a player selects a different floor THEN the system SHALL close the menu and initiate floor transition
3. WHEN a player selects the current floor THEN the system SHALL close the menu without moving the player
4. WHEN a player cancels the floor selection (ESC, B button, or back gesture) THEN the system SHALL close the menu and return to normal gameplay
5. IF a floor is inaccessible or locked THEN the system SHALL display the floor as disabled in the menu

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want the elevator system to move me to the correct position on the destination floor, so that I appear in a logical location after using the elevator.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player selects a destination floor THEN the system SHALL move the player to the corresponding elevator position on that floor
2. WHEN transitioning between floors THEN the system SHALL update the game's current floor state
3. WHEN transitioning between floors THEN the system SHALL update the camera and rendering to show the new floor
4. WHEN a player arrives on a new floor THEN the system SHALL position them at the elevator location on that floor
5. IF no corresponding elevator exists on the destination floor THEN the system SHALL position the player at a safe default location

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a game administrator, I want to configure elevator consoles in the room builder, so that I can create multi-floor layouts with proper elevator connectivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating furniture in the admin panel THEN administrators SHALL be able to place elevator console furniture items
2. WHEN placing an elevator console THEN the system SHALL automatically mark it as interactive furniture
3. WHEN placing an elevator console THEN administrators SHALL be able to configure which floors the elevator can access
4. WHEN saving a layout with elevator consoles THEN the system SHALL validate that elevators exist on connected floors
5. WHEN multiple elevators exist on the same floor THEN each SHALL provide access to the same set of connected floors

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want visual and audio feedback when using elevators, so that the floor transition feels responsive and immersive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a floor selection menu opens THEN the system SHALL display a clear, styled menu interface
2. WHEN navigating the floor selection menu THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback for the selected option
3. WHEN confirming a floor selection THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback before transitioning
4. WHEN transitioning between floors THEN the system SHALL show a brief transition effect or loading state
5. WHEN arriving on a new floor THEN the system SHALL update any floor-specific UI elements or indicators
