# Stargate Room Design Guidelines

## DHD Placement
- The DHD (Dial Home Device) must always be positioned 10-20 feet away from the Stargate
- The DHD should be placed to either the left or right side of the Stargate, never directly in front
- There must always be sufficient room for characters to walk into the Stargate past the DHD
- Standard DHD distance is approximately 3-6 meters (10-20 feet) from the center of the Stargate
  - At least 4-5 meters forward from the Stargate (along z-axis)
  - At least 3-4 meters to either side (along x-axis)
- DHD placement should allow for a clear line of sight to the Stargate from the operating position
- For gameplay purposes, ensure there's enough clearance around the DHD for characters to maneuver without getting stuck

## Additional Gate Room Guidelines
- The Stargate should be the focal point of the room
- Adequate space should be provided in front of the Stargate for the 'kawoosh' effect (unstable wormhole vortex)
- Consider appropriate lighting that highlights the Stargate
- Room dimensions should accommodate the Stargate's size (typically 6.7 meters in diameter)
- Clear pathways should lead to the Stargate entrance, with no obstacles in the immediate approach
