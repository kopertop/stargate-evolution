## Workflow Triggers

- **Push to main**: Automatic deployment
- **PR merged to main**: Automatic deployment after merge
- **Manual trigger**: Can be run manually from Actions tab

## Environment Protection

The `release-deploy.yml` workflow uses the `production` environment which allows you to:
- Add required reviewers
- Set deployment protection rules
- Add environment secrets
- Configure deployment branches

Configure this in your repository settings under Environments.
